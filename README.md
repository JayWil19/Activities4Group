# Activities4Group
Melissa Gnoth is the PTC employee in charge of student clubs. Currently she uses paper forms (see attached for a sample) to communicate with the club presidents and faculty advisors. She is tired of paper and manual entry and would like this to move to the web. You have been asked to develop this project for Mrs. Gnoth. While completing this project, you will follow the 5 steps of the Agile Project Management model from chapter 5. The first step, Envision, sets the stage for the remaining steps. This phase answers the questions on page 94. In this phase, you start to write the stories that are the requirements for the project. You also start choosing the technologies used in the project. You will have two weeks as a group to complete this project. To get a better feel for this part of the project, you should read chapter 6.
